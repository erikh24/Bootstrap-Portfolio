                <p class="text-light">Hello! I'm Erik. You probably know me as the guy who sits in the
                    middle row at
                    class who is always wearing a hat. What you may not know is that I am married
                    (15 years), have 1 son, 2 dogs (Stewie and Bowser) and 1
                    stupid cat (Kitty). I'm born and raised in WA and have a great family who all live pretty close
                    which is nice. My favorite holiday is Christmas and my least favorite (major) holiday is
                    Thanksgiving.
                </p>
                <p class="text-light">
                    During my free time (when not in this bootcamp), I enjoy playing video games
                    (Playstation 4, Xbox One, & Nintendo Switch), watching football (Go Cougs/Go Hawks), reading, going
                    to movies, riding mtn bike/motorcycle, and spending time with my wife, son and dogs. I also really
                    enjoy listening to music. Some of my favorite artists are Billy Joel, Chvrches, New Found Glory,
                    Taylor Swift (all her albums except her most recent album, that one was trash), Styx, Paramore and
                    Panic! At The Disco. I also really love Legos! I have a large collection made up mostly of the
                    larger sets that I have accumulated over the last
                    15 years or so. I had a lot of Legos when I was a kid and I was stupid and sold most of them at a
                    garage sale many years ago. That was one of the worst decisions that I've ever made.

                <p class="text-light">
                    Oh, and I work full time. I don't enjoy it. Not much else to say about that.
